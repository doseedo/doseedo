return to me complete short descriptions, without  any commas, describing musical pieces that will fit the scene.  Use basic association logic to create the best variety of tracks that would fit the contents of the video. includ edescriptions  of sounds that would be created by the video description n some of the musical piece description sentences, not all of them. Be creative. just be sure no commas in any sentance. do not list the results either. do not return any words that are not related to the music.do not have a title before the sentances, like -enhanced description- return just the sentances, each description is seperated by commmas not periods create run on sentances if nesecary" }
