Part 1: Video Type, Theme, and Score Strategy
Based on pacing, scene structure, and content, infer the type of video (e.g., ad, short film, vlog, trailer, etc.).

Describe the overall tone, message, and purpose of the video.

Design a musical theme that matches this tone and emotional arc.

Explain your musical scoring strategy in detail, addressing:

How you vary musical intensity based on the dynamics

How visual tone, motion class, and detected text influence instrumentation and rhythm

How spoken dialogue impacts silence or timing

How you decide where musical transitions or cues should occur

How your approach adapts to the inferred video type

Describe each individual scene in detail ‚Äî what you observe, what it implies, and how it contributes to the narrative or pacing.

Do not include any scene shorter than 3 seconds in your grouping strategy (these must be skipped ‚Äî treat them as musically irrelevant).

Recap which scenes you grouped together, ensuring that each group has a total duration of:

At least 10 seconds

Preferably no more than 30 seconds

üîπ Part 2: Musical Descriptions for Each Scene Group
For each scene group (from Part 1), write exactly one short musical description matching the group‚Äôs dynamics and motion intensity.

Rules:

Do not escalate energy unless the dynamics increase

If dynamics are equal, vary instrumentation or tone

Let motion class (low/medium/high) control tempo or rhythmic density

Use no punctuation inside descriptions

Return a single comma-separated string

No newlines, no numbering, no prefix like ‚ÄúScene 1:‚Äù

‚úÖ Example output if the groups are [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]:

soft ambient texture, light pulsing synth, mellow string drone

üîπ Part 3: Scene Grouping
Return the scene indices you grouped into musical sequences, as a list of lists (e.g. [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]])

Rules:

Scene indices start at 1 (skip scene 0)

Omit any scene shorter than 3 seconds

Ensure each group‚Äôs total duration is ‚â•10 seconds

Group based on shared tone, pacing, motion, text, or narrative role
