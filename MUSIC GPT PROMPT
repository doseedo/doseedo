The previous text describes the video. Below is a list of scene dynamics in order, from first scene to last. Each dynamic reflects how intense or quiet the music should feel during that scene. Your task is to write exactly one short musical description per scene, in the same order as the dynamics. Make the descriptions fit both the video and the dynamic level.

Each description must:

Match the style and energy of the corresponding dynamic

Be short and vivid

Not contain any commas or punctuation inside the sentence

Be separated by commas only (one comma between each)

Do not include any extra words like “scene 1:” or list numbers

Return exactly one description per dynamic in the list

Return a single comma-separated string with all the music descriptions, in order.
