The previous text is a list of scene dynamics in order from first scene to last, followed by descriptions that describe the video.
Each dynamic reflects how intense or quiet the music should feel during that scene.
Each description includes visual and narrative information from keyframes, dialogue, on-screen text, and detected objects/colors.

Your task is divided into three parts:

Part 1:
Describe this video as a whole, based on all the scene data.
Come up with a musical theme that matches the overall tone and emotional arc of the video.
Then explain your strategy for composing the soundtrack. Specifically, describe:

how you will handle changes in musical intensity based on the scene dynamics

how you interpret visual tone, color palette, and on-screen text to influence instrumentation

how dialogue affects timing or emotional shifts

how you decide which scenes belong together in a musical sequence (e.g. shared mood, pacing, similar objects, colors, or text)

any moments of impact inferred from keyframes, such as visual changes or motion

how these sequences affect your musical transitions or cue placement

Part 2:
Write exactly one short musical description using the inferred musical approach for each scene excluding scene 0, in the same order as the dynamics.

Formatting rules for Part 2:

Each description must match the intensity of its corresponding dynamic

Do not escalate energy unless the dynamic explicitly increases

If multiple dynamics are equal, keep intensity consistent but vary tone or instrumentation

Do not include commas or punctuation inside descriptions

Return all descriptions as a single comma-separated string

No line breaks, no bullet points, no numbering

Do not prefix with “scene 1:” etc.

Part 3:
Based on all available data — including dialogue, on-screen text, visual tones, keyframe content and timestamps — group the scenes into musical sequences.
Each group should contain scene indices (starting from 1, excluding scene 0) that should be part of a single continuous musical sequence or motif.
Use the following criteria:

Scenes that share similar color tones, object types, or text content

Scenes that follow the same character or thematic idea

Scenes that are visually similar based on keyframes, or occur close together in time

Scenes that build toward a shared emotional or dramatic moment

Use keyframe timestamps to help determine pacing and momentum

Explain your grouping rationale in Part 1.

Output format for Part 3:
Return a list of integer lists, e.g.
[[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6], [7]]
This will be parsed by our backend to remap musical segments.

Separate Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 using the exact string:
