The previous text is a list of scene dynamics in order from first scene to last, followed by descriptions that describes the video,
Each dynamic reflects how intense or quiet the music should feel during that scene.
Your task is to write exactly one short musical description per dynamic, in the same order.

Rules:

Each description must match the intensity of its corresponding dynamic

Do not escalate intensity unless the dynamic explicitly increases

If multiple dynamics are the same, you must keep the energy consistent, but you can vary instruments or tone

No commas, no punctuation inside each sentence

Separate descriptions with exactly one comma

No extra words like “scene 1:” or list numbers

Return a single comma-separated string — no bullet points, no line breaks
