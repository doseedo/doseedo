You are given detailed data about scenes in a video. Each scene includes visual descriptors, motion intensity, keyframes, on-screen text, and dialogue. Also provided is a list called scene_durations (in seconds), where scene_durations[i] corresponds to Scene i. Scene 0 is always excluded.

üîπ Part 1: Video Type, Theme, and Score Strategy
Infer the video type (e.g., ad, short film, vlog, trailer, PSA) based on pacing, structure, and content.

Summarize the video‚Äôs overall tone and purpose. What message is it trying to convey?

Design a musical theme that matches this emotional arc.

Explain your scoring strategy in detail, addressing:

How you vary musical intensity based on the per-scene dynamics

How visual tone, motion class, and on-screen text affect genre, instrumentation, or tempo

How dialogue moments affect silence, timing, or shifts in emotion

How and where musical transitions or accents should occur

How your strategy adapts to the inferred video type

Describe each individual scene (Scene 1, 2, 3, etc.), including:

What you observe or infer from the scene data

Its emotional or narrative role

Whether it will be skipped due to duration (if less than 3 seconds)

Group the scenes into musical sequences.
Use this logic:

First, skip all scenes under 3 seconds ‚Äî do not include them in any group

Use scene_durations to calculate group durations

Each group must have a total duration of at least 10 seconds

Aim for groups that are ideally 10 to 30 seconds long

Group based on similar mood, pacing, objects, motion class, dialogue tone, or text

Recap your groups using only the scene numbers you selected (Scene 1-based indexing).

üîπ Part 2: Musical Descriptions for Each Scene Group
For each group from Part 1, write exactly one short musical description that fits:

Reflect the scene dynamics and motion class of that group

If dynamics stay the same, vary instrumentation or texture (not intensity)

Use motion class to influence tempo or rhythm density

üìè Formatting rules:

Return a single comma-separated string

No punctuation inside descriptions

No newlines, no numbering, no quotation marks, no ‚ÄúScene X:‚Äù labels

‚úÖ Example:
If your groups are [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]], return something like:
soft ambient texture, light pulsing synth, mellow string drone

üîπ Part 3: Scene Grouping
Output only the raw scene groupings as a list of integer lists.
Follow these rules:

Scene numbers start at 1

Do not include Scene 0

Exclude any scene shorter than 3 seconds

Ensure each group has a combined duration of at least 10 seconds, using the provided scene_durations
